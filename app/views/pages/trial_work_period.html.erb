    <p>This is a nine-month period that allows the <strong>SSDI</strong> beneficiary
      to test his or her ability to work without losing benefits. The <strong>SSI
      </strong> program has <strong>NO</strong> trial work period (TWP). During the
      nine TWP months, the individual will be allowed to get both a paycheck and
      <strong>SSDI</strong> check no matter what the mount of earnings. The nine
      months need not be consecutive. Once an individual had used up nine TWP months
      within and 60 consecutive months, TWP is over.</p>
