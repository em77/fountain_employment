<div class="page_content_box">
  <p>This is a nine-month period that allows the <strong>SSDI</strong> beneficiary
    to test his or her ability to work without losing benefits. The <strong>SSI
    </strong> program has <strong>NO</strong> trial work period (TWP). During the
    nine TWP months, the individual will be allowed to get both a paycheck and
    <strong>SSDI</strong> check no matter what the mount of earnings. The nine
    months need not be consecutive. Once an individual had used up nine TWP months
    within and 60 consecutive months, TWP is over.</p>

    <h4>Substantial Gainful Activity (SGA)</h4>
    <p>SGA is the amount of monthly Earned Income an employee can make in a single month (4 weeks) and still maintain their full SSD check. If an employee makes more than the SGA in unearned income in a single month then they will no longer receive a check for SSD next month. The exceptions to this rule would be getting a subsidy letter from Fountain House Employment Resource Center. See someone in the Employment Resource Center for more information on Subsidy Letters.</p>
