        Fountain House recently launched a social enterprise and social
        cooperative program designed to create alternative employment
        opportunities and encourage entrepreneurship among members.
        <br><br>
        Social enterprise achieves a double bottom-line. It offers affordable,
        top-quality services to clients while providing employees from
        traditionally marginalized populations with the opportunity to enter the
        workforce and obtain invaluable job skills.Â  Through innovative and
        entrepreneurial ventures, members learn industry specific skills that are
        transferable in the marketplace.
